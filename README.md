An important part of the code is borrowed from [Kai Chen's website](http://kaichen.work/?p=1032). I appreciated that Kai made his code available.
My code gets more information (judge, docket, industry, sector, class period dates, case summary), encapsulates better the functions and variables, and speeds up some parts of the code.
